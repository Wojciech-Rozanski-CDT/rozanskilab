# Policy Compliance Tracker

## Background

Policies are one of the primary methods used to ensure that the Client's Azure environment is kept secure and adhers to our standards.
It might happen however, that under certain conditions certain resources will need to be exempted from a given policy due to their status. It is crucial to keep track of such occurences as exemptions often lower the security posture of the environment.

This document will be used to track all exemptions configured within the Client's environment.
A list of all JIRA tickets raised to create exemptions should be kept for reference and updated each time a ticket is raised.

## Exemption Table
