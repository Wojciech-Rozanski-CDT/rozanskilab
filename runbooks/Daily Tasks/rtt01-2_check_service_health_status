### Steps

1. Log on to Azure.
2. (optional) If accessing the portal via a Lighthouse account, set the subscription filter to show subscriptions from the relevant Tenant only.
3. Check if there are active service health issues.
4. Navigate to Azure Active Directory
5. Check for any active service issues and alerts.

In case of any service health issues, a JIRA ticket should be raised.
Alerts might show up about services that are not in use in that Customet's tenant. In such case the Squad Lead should be contacted to verify if a JIRA ticket is necessary.
The primary Client Contact should be informed about any service health issues.
